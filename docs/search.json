In this course, we will consider the following problems: classification, cluster and outlier analysis, mining time-series and sequence data, text mining and web mining, pattern analysis.\nA lecture-based module open to all students with a suitable grounding. It covers the fundamental data mining ideas (clustering, support vector machine analysis, semi-supervised learning, information retrieval, collaborative filtering, harmonic analysis) and the most important algorithms (the k-means algorithm, support vector machines, PageRank algorithm, k-nearest neighbor classification, Naive Bayes).\n\n\nCourse Materials\nAll of the readings in this course are free. R, RStudio and Python are free and available online.\n\n\nR and RStudio\nYou can find instruction on installing R and RStudio here\n\n\nPython and Jupyter Notebook\nTo learn more on installing Python and Jupyter Notebook read here\n\n\nBrief Video on Data Mining\nWatch this video for brief insight on data mining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment and Course Assessment\nYou can find the set of class assignments on the assignment section\nThe course grades are as follows\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n70-100\n\n\nB\n60-69\n\n\nc\n50-59\n\n\nF\n0-49\n\n\n\nThe pass mark is 50 and Above\nFor continuous assessment test they account 40% of the total score and they will be distributed as follows:\n\n\n\nContinuous Assessment\nContribution\n\n\n\n\nMini-project\n15%\n\n\nPresentation\n10%\n\n\nCAT\n10%\n\n\nAssignments\n5%"
