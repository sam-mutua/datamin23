# Course Purpose

The **purpose of the course** is to equip learners for developing, manipulating, recovering and maintaining databases.


# Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course the learner should be able to:

- Explain the concepts of data mining
- Apply mining on different kinds of data
- Apply mining on different kinds of knowledge 
- Discuss principles of pattern analysis and machine learning
- Demonstrate representation discovery using Harmonic Analysis

This class will expose you to [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) the leading programming languages in this century. 

This module provides an introduction to the basic ideas and methods of mathematical data mining. In this course, we will consider the following problems: classification, cluster and outlier analysis, mining time-series and sequence data, text mining and web mining, pattern analysis.

A lecture-based module open to all students with a suitable grounding. It covers the fundamental data mining ideas (clustering, support vector machine analysis, semi-supervised learning, information retrieval, collaborative filtering, harmonic analysis) and the most important algorithms (the k-means algorithm, support vector machines, PageRank algorithm, k-nearest neighbor classification, Naive Bayes).


# Course Materials

All of the readings in this course are **free**. R, RStudio and Python are free and available online. 

# R and RStudio

# Assignment and Course Assessment

You can find the set of class assignments on the [assignment section](/assignment/assignment.qmd)

The course grades are as follows

| Grade | Range  |
|-------|--------|
| A     | 70-100 |
| B     | 60-69  |
| c     | 50-59  |
| F     | 0-49   |

The pass mark is **50 and Above**

For continuous assessment test they account **40%** of the total score and they will be distributed as follows:

| Continuous Assessment | Contribution |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Mini-project          | 15%          |
| Presentation          | 10%          |
| CAT                   | 10%          |
| Assignments           | 5%           |
